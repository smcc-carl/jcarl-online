        <p class="pt-16 pb-4 text-4xl font-semibold">WHY I DON&#39;T USE WORDPRESS ON MY PORTFOLIO?</p>
        <p class="py-4 px-6">Everybody loves WordPress, and so do I. It’s a powerful and widely used content management system that has made creating websites accessible for millions of users. However, when it comes to building my own portfolio—especially if you’re a startup business or developer looking for a lightweight, highly optimized solution—I’ve chosen a different path. This isn’t about discrediting WordPress or dismissing its value. It’s simply a personal decision based on my own experiences, workflow preferences, and the unique needs of my projects. There are specific reasons why, in the context of a professional portfolio, I believe alternative tools can offer a better fit.</p>
        <p class='font-bold text-2xl py-8'>1. WordPress isn’t low-end PC friendly</p>
        <p class="px-6">Developing a WordPress site locally can be an uphill battle if you’re working on a low-end PC. Setting up a local environment often involves using resource-intensive tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or Local by Flywheel. For a startup business or developer just starting out—often with limited access to high-end hardware—this can quickly become a frustrating experience. Simple tasks such as editing pages or testing themes may feel slow and unresponsive, which can hinder productivity and result in longer development cycles. As a developer, time and efficiency are critical, and you don’t want to spend most of your time waiting for environments to load or scripts to execute. This heavy dependency on robust hardware makes WordPress less ideal when agility is essential for delivering quick results, especially during the early stages of building your portfolio.</p>
        <p class='font-bold text-2xl py-8'>2. Hosting is a must-have, not a choice</p>
        <p class="px-6">One of the key considerations for any startup or developer is budget. While WordPress itself is free to use, it still requires hosting to run effectively. Finding a reliable and affordable hosting service is crucial, but not always easy. The best workaround for new developers or small businesses might be to use free hosting services like InfinityFree.net. However, such services come with a host of limitations—limited storage, restricted bandwidth, and reduced control over server configurations. You may even face restrictions on custom domains or database management, which can hinder your ability to fully customize and optimize your site. For a simple portfolio, these limitations can feel unnecessarily complex. You end up spending more time figuring out workarounds instead of focusing on building a site that showcases your skills and expertise.</p>
        <p class='font-bold text-2xl py-8'>3. Optimization becomes a juggling act</p>
        <p class="px-6">When you’re presenting your work to potential clients or employers, your portfolio needs to reflect the quality of your skills and attention to detail. Speed and performance play a critical role in making a great first impression. Unfortunately, WordPress sites can be notoriously difficult to optimize without additional help. Straight out of the box, they often require several plugins to achieve the kind of performance you want. Whether it’s caching, image compression, or script minification, each new plugin adds to the overall weight of your site. For a developer or startup, where a polished, fast-loading website is a necessity, these added layers of complexity can become counterproductive. The more plugins you install, the greater the risk of conflicts, security vulnerabilities, and—most importantly—performance degradation. For a portfolio, where simplicity and speed are paramount, WordPress can sometimes feel like more of a hindrance than a help.</p>

        <p class='font-bold text-2xl py-8'>Conclusion</p>

        <p class='px-6'>If you’re a startup business or developer building your portfolio, consider using an alternative like 11ty (Eleventy). Portfolios are meant to be straightforward, efficient, and easy to maintain—a showcase of your skills, not a complex project that requires heavy infrastructure. With 11ty, you get a static site generator that’s lightweight, easy to learn, and incredibly powerful for creating highly optimized, fast-loading websites. The development process is smoother, and it doesn’t require a hefty investment in hardware or premium hosting plans. For small businesses or developers, it’s a solution that allows you to focus on your craft rather than battling technical limitations. While 11ty is perfect for portfolios and static sites, I still believe WordPress is unmatched when it comes to building dynamic, feature-rich websites. But for a simple, high-performing portfolio that truly represents who you are and what you do, 11ty is the perfect fit.</p>
